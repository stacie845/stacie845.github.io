 Kirby was created by Masahiro Sakurai at HAL Laboratory in 1990, initially as a simple placeholder graphic for the Game Boy game Kirby's Dream Land. The developers grew fond of the "blob" character, which was temporarily named "Popopo," and it became the game's protagonist. The name was changed to Kirby to appeal to Western audiences, partially in honor of American lawyer John Kirby.   </p>
